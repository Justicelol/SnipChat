<h2>Use of the Extension</h2>
<p>
SnipChat provides a tool allowing Twitch streamers to temporarily hide on-screen chat

</ul>

<h2>Data & Storage</h2>
<p>
SnipChat does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit personal data.
Local preferences (crop rectangle, Pro settings, etc.) may be stored
in Twitch's Extension Configuration system or your browser’s local storage.
</p>

<h2>Subscriptions (Pro)</h2>
<p>
Pro features may be billed through a third-party such as Stripe.
